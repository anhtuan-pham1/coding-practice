# Coding Practice
This is my practice for coding interview. I mainly use Python for coding practice but I am learning Java to enhance my skillsets.

# Resource

I use [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Binarysearch.com](https://binarysearch.com/), and Cracking the Coding Interview to study new languages and practice.
